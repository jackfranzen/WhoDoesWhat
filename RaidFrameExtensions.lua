local WhoDoesWhat = LibStub("AceAddon-3.0"):GetAddon("WhoDoesWhat")

-- Draws a raider's WDW spec icon onto Blizzard's compact raid (and raid-style
-- party) frames, standing in for the group icon the client draws there -- the
-- main-tank / main-assist marker, or the tank/healer/damager symbol.
--
-- Display only, and deliberately quiet: a player whose spec has neither been
-- chosen on the board nor scanned from their talents gets nothing from us.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- We draw into a texture of our OWN and hide the client's behind it, and the
-- only thing we ever change on the client's side is that texture's ALPHA.
--
-- The first version of this repainted the client's `roleIcon` in place, which
-- meant borrowing its size, anchor, coordinates and gradient and owing every
-- one of them back. Each was a way to strand the client's icon somewhere it
-- could not recover from: a leftover band mask rendered its role icon as a
-- zoomed slice of itself, and a restore that put back a size but never a Show
-- left the corner empty until a reload built the frames again. There is no
-- amount of care that makes borrowing safe, because handing it back means
-- reproducing a decision -- shown, sized and atlased from the unit -- that is
-- the client's to make and ours only to guess at.
--
-- Alpha is the whole of the bargain now. The client keeps its own geometry, so
-- nothing of ours can distort it; it goes on drawing its icon at full size
-- underneath, invisibly, and putting the corner back is SetAlpha(1) on a
-- texture that never stopped being correct. Nothing in the client writes alpha
-- on this texture, so it stays put between our passes without a fight.
--
-- It also gets the text right for free. The client anchors the name to the
-- role icon's edge, so every attempt to resize that icon dragged the name
-- around and had to be corrected back -- the source of the indented and
-- floating names. An icon that keeps its size does not move the name at all,
-- so every style now leaves the client's own text layout untouched.
--
-- What we do NOT leave alone is the raid profile's own show/hide of that
-- corner: a known spec draws even where the profile has role icons switched
-- off, and over the vehicle icon. Our setting is the switch for this, and a
-- feature that silently drew nothing because of a checkbox in a different
-- window would just read as broken.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Styles
--
-- "corner" stands in for the client's own icon where it draws it: a round one,
-- masked and ringed, at 0.78 of the size it uses (17px in the default profile,
-- so 13) and centred on the spot its own icon occupies. Being a replacement
-- rather than an addition, it is also the one style that draws NOTHING for a
-- player the board has no role for -- it simply stands down, and the client's
-- own group role icon is there already, at full alpha, needing nothing from us.
--
-- The band styles instead run the icon down an edge of the health bar, from
-- the top corner to just above the power bar. The health bar is the right
-- thing to measure against rather than the frame: the client anchors it from
-- the frame's top-left down to exactly where the power bar starts, so its edge
-- already IS that span -- no power-bar arithmetic here, and a profile with the
-- power bar switched off lengthens the band on its own.
--
-- "band" ends on a dark hairline, so it stays narrow enough to read as a
-- stripe. "bandFaded" dissolves inward instead, and that is what pays for its
-- width: a tail that costs nothing visually can run out to square. Both
-- mirror onto the bar's other edge as the "Right" pair.
--
-- These are whole pixels on purpose. The offsets are UI units, not device
-- pixels, so a fractional one lands mid-pixel and softens the icon's edge
-- instead of moving it -- there is no half step here worth having.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

local ICON_SCALE = 0.78

-- Where the name goes once a band has taken over the corner. The client's icon
-- is invisible under our stand-in but still 17px wide, and the name is anchored
-- off its edge, so left to itself the name keeps an indent for an icon nobody
-- can see -- which is a lot of daylight on a 72px frame.
--
-- Given as an absolute inset from the frame rather than a nudge, so it says
-- where the name lands rather than how far it moved, and re-stated as the
-- client's own no-icon spot (its 3px inset plus the 1px a hidden icon collapses
-- to) when there is nothing in the way at all. A band that fades has nothing in
-- the way; an opaque one wants clearing by a couple of pixels.

-- `unknown`   what to draw for a player with no board role. Absent means draw
--             NOTHING for them -- which for the corner style is the whole
--             point: it replaces the client's icon, so standing down is what
--             lets the client's own group role show through untouched. We
--             never have to reproduce that icon or reason about drawing over
--             it, because the one we would be covering is simply left alone.
-- `nameLeft`  absolute inset for the name's left anchor; absent leaves it.
-- `nameRight` the same for its right anchor, to keep a name off an opaque
--             strip running down that side.
