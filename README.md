# WhoDoesWhat

**WhoDoesWhat is an addon for managing raider roles and assignments (with instant fixes for Paladin buff assignments) for WoW Classic and TBC!**

Open one window with `/wdw` or the minimap button to organize tanks, crowd control, misdirects, Warlock curses, and Paladin blessings. Permitted changes sync to everyone in the group running WhoDoesWhat, while built-in whisper buttons make it easy to brief players who are not.

> WhoDoesWhat is in active beta. Features and interfaces may change as raid testing continues.

## Raid Assignments

- **Tank assignments** - assign tanks to raid markers, custom targets, or an "everything else" catch-all.
- **Crowd control** - assign supported, class-appropriate CC by marker or custom target.
- **Misdirects** - pair Hunters with tanks and optionally identify the pull by raid marker in TBC.
- **Warlock curses** - assign curses manually or automatically. TBC prefers an Affliction Warlock for Elements; Classic assigns Elements, Shadow, and Recklessness to separate Warlocks.
- **Fast communication** - whisper one player's full job list, one section, or the whole board.
- **Unit-menu controls** - set roles and manage tank, CC, and misdirect assignments from player right-click menus.
- **Roles on raid frames** - each raider's spec icon is drawn onto Blizzard's raid frames, over the group icon usually shown there: as a round icon replacing the group icon, or as a band down either edge of the health bar, narrow and hard-edged or wider and fading out under the name. Players whose spec has not been chosen or scanned keep the corner Blizzard drew. Settings > General picks the style, turns it off, or limits it to out of combat.

Warnings call out incomplete or conflicting assignments before the pull.

## Automatic Paladin Blessings

WhoDoesWhat scans each Paladin's Improved Might, Improved Wisdom, Kings, and Sanctuary talents, then combines that information with every raider's role and blessing priorities to build an optimized plan automatically. Paladin coverage is derived from the current roster and is never stored as a pile of manual per-player assignments.

The default priorities cover standard specs and specialist roles such as Mage, Warlock, and Boomkin tanks. Priorities can be reordered, blessings can be disabled, and custom class-specific roles can be created for unusual raid strategies.

Raid-wide buff rules provide additional control: prioritize a blessing for a role or class, ignore it, or prefer a particular Paladin.

## PallyPower Interoperability

- **WDW mode** uses WhoDoesWhat's computed blessing plan.
- **PallyPower mode** treats live or observed PallyPower assignments as the raid's active plan.
- **One-click sync** broadcasts the WDW plan over PallyPower's own protocol, even when the sender does not have PallyPower installed.
- **Diff and Fix tools** show meaningful coverage differences and repair the full plan or an affected player's assignments.
- **Two-way visibility** reports a Paladin who has no PallyPower installed to the PallyPower users in the raid, so they appear in the PallyPower window and can be assigned blessings there like anyone else.

PallyPower clients normally accept assignments for other Paladins only from the raid leader or an assistant unless Free Assignment is enabled.

## Buff Tracking and Buffing Buttons

Blessing progress is visible on the main window, the **WDW Status** bars, and the **Buffing Grid**. These views can also track raid buffs such as Fortitude, Mark/Gift of the Wild, Intellect, Shadow Protection, and Well Fed. Scanned Fortitude, Mark/Gift, and Thorns buffs warn when a stronger talented provider was available.

Thorns and deaths are also tracked; TBC additionally includes Sated/Exhaustion and Tinnitus from drums. Every applicable check appears in both views by default; Dead is status-bar-only and cannot be enabled in the Buffing Grid. Active Hunter pets participate in the blessing plan, and their planned blessings and Well Fed status can be tracked. Dead raiders stop counting as missing buffs while you are in combat, since nobody can rebuff a corpse mid-fight. Sated counts every summoned pet, so a Shadowfiend that missed the lust shows up too, and its tooltip names whoever is still Sated out of combat but whoever the lust missed once you are fighting.

The **Buff Tracking** settings page independently chooses which checks appear in WDW Status and the Buffing Grid. Arrow buttons order the status rows; disabling Bars moves a check below a divider that appears only when needed. Paladin Buff Notifications reports PallyPower assignment drift. Paladin Buff Progress normally shows one row per Paladin, with a cog option to combine them into one raid-wide row. Debuff checks can hide empty rows and grid columns and choose their saturated indicator. Each cog exposes only relevant options, including compact text/color, provider availability, target filters, and notification visibility or assistant glows. Sated adds **Glow when some missing**, which pulses once most of the raid has lust but a few do not — the handful worth a second Bloodlust — with an optional **Only as Shaman** to keep the nudge to the people who can cast it. The color picker fills every status bar for live comparison, and the page can reset every check to defaults at once.

The movable **Paladin Buffing Bar** is a secure alternative to PallyPower's buffing UI and works with either WDW or PallyPower assignments. Left-click casts assigned Greater Blessings; right-click cycles assigned Lesser Blessings, prioritizing missing or expiring buffs. PallyPower does not need to be installed.

## Roles and Raid Setup

- Standard roles are detected from talents and follow respecs without overwriting deliberate manual choices.
- Roles can be changed from the Raid Members window or a player's right-click menu.
- Role changes update the blessing plan and can immediately repair the affected PallyPower assignments.
- The group leader is the single writer for other players' Blizzard role flags, preventing competing addons or assistants from fighting over them.
- Main-tank demotions are automatic. When Blizzard prevents addon-driven promotion, WhoDoesWhat highlights tanks awaiting promotion after the leader opens the Raid panel.
- Custom roles and per-role blessing priorities are saved between sessions.

## Warlock Tools

WhoDoesWhat displays the available Improved Healthstone ranks and supports manual or one-click curse assignment.

The optional Details!-backed **Curse Value Calculator** estimates damage provided or missed by each raid curse. It supports Classic's three-curse setup and Ignite behavior, plus TBC Malediction and Blood Frenzy. These are estimates based on encounter data and the armor, uptime, and debuff assumptions shown in the calculator.

## Sync and Permissions

The raid leader chooses who may edit the shared board: the leader, one named assistant, all assistants, or everyone. Other players receive a clean read-only view.

Permitted edits synchronize roles, tank targets, CC, misdirects, curses, blessing rules, and the raid's WDW/PallyPower mode. New arrivals automatically request the leader's current board, and compatible clients share talent information to populate roles and utility ranks faster.
