-- Live tracking of which supported raid buffs are ACTUALLY active on each
-- raider. This is a shared data layer: the paladin grid consumes blessings to
-- red-flag missing assignments, while WDW Status consumes the core raid buffs.
--
-- The approach mirrors NovaConsumesHelper / NovaRaidCompanion, which track raid
-- buffs the same way and work well on this client:
--   * Read auras through the modern C_UnitAuras API (GetBuffDataByIndex),
--     falling back to indexed UnitBuff on an older client that lacks it.
--   * Event-driven: UNIT_AURA re-scans just the unit whose auras changed, so a
--     nearby (re)buff shows instantly; a slow full-group poll backstops it for
--     anything UNIT_AURA doesn't deliver (it fires unreliably for distant
--     units). These buffs last minutes, so a few seconds of lag is fine.
--
-- Range (TBC 2.5.5): unlike retail, the aura LIST for a group member is
-- available regardless of range. Duration/expiration may be stale out of
-- range, but presence and the last observed expiry still support the grid.
--
-- Per-raider states:
--   * present -- the aura is on them
--   * missing -- the aura isn't there (this red-flags). A dead or offline
--                raider still reads as missing, so a corpse shows red and you
--                can rebuff the instant they're back up.
--   * unknown -- not yet scanned, or no real unit (fake raiders); never flags
