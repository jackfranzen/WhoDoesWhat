            "Added the Warrior Shout Bar: one clickable icon per shout, counts relevant party members. Added \"melee\" hunter role.",
            "The Paladin Bar can stand up as a vertical column, with per-class expiry countdowns, an aura picker that casts, and an alt-right-click switch that hands the raid over to PallyPower.",
            "WhoDoesWhat roles can be drawn on Blizzard's raid frames, in five styles from a round replacement icon to a faded band down the health bar.",
            "Shift-left-click a status bar to whisper whoever can fix it -- the paladins, the priests, or everyone still needing to eat.",
            "Status bar announces and whispers now count forwards, name the stragglers only while there are few of them, and are signed like every other message the addon sends.",
            "Status bar rows glow in a highlight style of your choosing, in a color of your choosing, with a live preview in the settings.",
            "Divine Spirit is tracked on TBC, including who can cast it at all and who would have to respec first.",
            "Buffs cast by somebody outside the raid are counted as missing, and named separately in the tooltip.",
            "Hunter pets are matched for blessings across every paladin rather than the leftovers, and a Steam Tonk is no longer mistaken for one.",
            "Paladin Trash Tank is now Threat Tank, and the Arms and Enhancement icons were refreshed.",

            "Action Items folded into the Members window: roles, talents, and what needs fixing in one place.",
            "Ignore a blessing for part of the raid -- \"Sanctuary except for Tanks\" is now one rule.",
            "A paladin running without PallyPower announces themselves to it, so they can be given assignments.",
            "Raid assistants can set group roles by hand again.",
            "Large-raid performance pass; the biggest gains are in a 40-man with several paladins.",

            "Roles that disagree with the last talent scan are now flagged.",

            "Paladin auras are picked from a hover grid instead of cycling.",
            "Sated glows when a lust leaves raiders behind.",
            "Hunter pets show their own name, with the owner behind it.",
            "The promote prompt now reaches every assistant, including after a late promotion.",
            "Rebuilt the buffing rules and consolidated blessing fallbacks; the best-available rule relaxes in combat.",
            "PallyPower fixes skip roleless raiders, and the \"upsetting the raid\" warning only appears without rights.",
            "Status bars are on by default, with clearer shortcuts.",
            "Fixed accented names rendering half a byte as their initials.",
            "Fixed roster repaints closing an open role dropdown, and a stale cache replay claiming a respec.",
