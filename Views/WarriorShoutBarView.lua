-- The Warrior Shout Bar: a small movable strip of one icon per warrior shout
-- (Battle Shout always, Commanding Shout on TBC), each glowing while anybody
-- in the PARTY who wants that shout is missing it -- red on nobody, yellow
-- part-way through. The paladin's
-- Buffing Bar answers "what do I still have to cast"; this answers the much
-- smaller warrior version of the same question, which is "is my shout up".
--
-- A shout reaches the caster's party and no further, so every number on this
-- bar is scoped to the local player's subgroup (PartyNames below) -- the
-- coverage counts and the warrior count alike. A raid-wide count would report
-- a gap in group 5 that nothing this warrior does can close.
--
-- Who counts as missing it, within that party:
--   Battle Shout      the roles that want it (WhoDoesWhat:WantsBattleShout,
--                     Data.lua) plus hunter pets, who are standing on the boss
--                     even when their hunter isn't.
--   Commanding Shout  everyone, pets included -- it is health, and nobody in
--                     the party turns that down.
-- Fake raiders, non-raiders, the disconnected and the dead are all out, as is
-- anybody nowhere near you once the range option is on.
--
-- How many icons: one warrior can only keep one shout up, so a party with a
-- lone warrior gets one icon -- right-click it to choose which shout that is.
-- Two or more warriors, and the second shout is somebody's job, so both show.
--
-- Left-click a button to cast its shout. Each one's spell never changes, so
-- unlike the paladin bar there is no rotation to rebake -- the secure
-- attributes are set once at creation and never touched again. What the secure
-- template does cost is the combat-lockdown discipline around LAYOUT: a
-- protected button cannot be created, shown, hidden or moved mid-fight, and
-- neither can the bar that parents it. So in combat this file repaints counts
-- and glows only, and PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED settles anything the fight changed.
--
-- Chrome is optional throughout: the backdrop, the counts, and each icon in
-- turn can all be switched off (the last one only while ITS shout is up, and
-- it comes straight back when that shout lapses -- see ApplyIdleFade).
--
-- Styled like the Paladin Bar (dark backdrop, tooltip border) but with no
-- title strip: at one icon wide there is no room for a caption, and the strip
-- was the only reason the bar was ever wider than its icons. Alt-drag anywhere
-- on it to move it; shift-right-click any button for its settings.

-- which matters because this flips mid-fight constantly, exactly when a
-- protected child forbids Show/Hide.
--
-- The cost of fading in place is that a faded icon keeps its slot: with one of
-- two shouts quiet you get an icon and a gap rather than a bar that shrinks
-- around the survivor. Repacking would mean moving a protected button, which
-- is the one thing combat forbids -- and combat is when this happens.
--
-- An alpha-0 frame still swallows mouse clicks, so the mouse comes off with
-- it. THAT part is lockdown-bound, so an icon that fades mid-fight keeps
-- catching clicks in its footprint until the fight ends.
